      <p>
        I need to have about $28,000  for the combination of tuition
        and six months living expenses while I attend the program and
        look for a job afterwards. I will be able to fund part of that
        out of my savings. I can raise more through short term loans
        in my personal network. And Hack Reactor has some funding options
        of their own, which I would prefer to avoid, but which I may have to use.
