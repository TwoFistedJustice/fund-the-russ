  The original goal: I had a decent job in accounting, with a goal  of independent
  study and saving enough money in 2018 to attend Hack Reactor coding bootcamp in
  2019 and then switching career paths to software engineer.

        On March 13th, 2018 my decent job got outsourced to India. So I could either
        scramble to find  a new job and probably have to postpone my goal another year,
        or jump for my goal now. So I jumped.
