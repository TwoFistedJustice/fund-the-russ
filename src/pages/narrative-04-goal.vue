        What am I doing to make this happen: I have thrown
        myself into full study mode. I have already completed
        the first part of the Hack Reactor preparation material
        and have begun their structured study program. I will be
        studying about eight hours a day, six days a week  from
        March 19th through April 14th to prepare for Hack
        Reactor's technical admissions interview.
