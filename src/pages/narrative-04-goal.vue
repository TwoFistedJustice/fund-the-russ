        I have been accepted into the Hack Reactor software engineering immersive bootcamp
        from June 11, 2018 to September 3rd, 2018. The non-refundable deposit could have bought
        me another motorcycle.

      <p><b>3/20/18</b><br>
        My goal is to attend the Hack Reactor software engineering immersive bootcamp
          from June 11, 2018 to September 3rd, 2018.

        I am throwing myself into full study mode. I have already completed
        the Hack Reactor structured study program.
        This took me a solid three weeks of not doing anything else.
        And that's just to prepare for Hack
        Reactor's technical admissions interview.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Hack Reactor I plan to work for a year in regular software development job
        in order to gain experience and knowledge, then focus on making software that focuses
        on fostering community and making motorcycling more enjoyable.
