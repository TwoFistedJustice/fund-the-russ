      <p>
        : Hack Reactor is one of the best-quality and best-known coding bootcamps
        in the world. I have friends who have gone through the program and now
        work as senior software engineers. Having the Hack Reactor brand underlying
        my resume will significantly increase my chances of getting positive attention
        from potential employers.
